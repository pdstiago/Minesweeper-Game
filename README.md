# Minesweeper Game
As the Final Project for Computing I course at UFRJ, me and my group, made a the Minesweeper game in C

The game has three dificulty levels: Easy, 9x9 board with 10 mines / Medium 16x16 board with 40 mines / Hard 16x30 board with 99 mines

The game also stores the best time that a user won the game for each difficulty and display a leaderboard in each difficulty
