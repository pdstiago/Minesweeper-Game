# Minesweeper Game
As the Final Project for Computing I course at UFRJ, me and my group, made a the Minesweeper game in C

The game has three dificulty levels: Easy, 9x9 board with 10 mines / Medium 16x16 board with 40 mines / Hard 16x30 board with 99 mines


## Features of the Minesweeper:
-Very cool welcome, win and lost texts, besides a beautiful board for the minesweeper 

-Stores the best time for every user that won the game in a certain difficulty level in a file, e.g if you won a game twice in Easy level the best time you be considerated and stored in the "easy_records" file, that contains the bests time for every user that beat the game in Easy level in increasing order

-Message displayed if the user beat his own record

-Message displayed with how much time was left for the user to beat his own record 

-Displays the leaderboard with the top three times and the name of the users with these times, in each difficulty level

-Very easy to follow gameplay, and safe against possible input mistakes

## Hope you enjoy ðŸ˜„
